    <br>
    Q.12 How manay type of Operators in js and Every operator and exmaple?<br>
    -->There are six types of operators in JavaScript.<br>
    1.Arithmetic Operators:
    <li>
        + Addition 10+20 = 30<br>
        - Subtraction 20-10 = 10<br>
        * Multiplication 10*20 = 200<br>
        / Division 20/10 = 2<br>
        % Modulus (Remainder) 20%10 = 0<br>
        ++ Increment var a=10; a++; Now a = 11<br>
        -- Decrement var a=10; a--; Now a = 9<br>
    </li><br>
    2.Comparison (Relational) Operators:
    <li>
        == Is equal to 10==20 = false<br>
        === Identical (equal and of same type) 10==20 = false<br>
        != Not equal to 10!=20 = true<br>
        !== Not Identical 20!==20 = false<br>
        > Greater than 20>10 = true<br>
        >= Greater than or equal to 20>=10 = true<br>
        <!-- < Less than 20<10=false <=Less than or equal to 20 <=10=false  --><br>
    </li><br>
    3.Logical Operators:
    <li>
        && Logical AND (10==20 && 20==33) = false<br>
        || Logical OR (10==20 || 20==33) = false<br>
        ! Logical Not !(10==20) = true<br>
    </li><br>
    4.Assignment Operators:
    <li>
        = Assign 10+10 = 20<br>
        += Add and assign var a=10; a+=20; Now a = 30<br>
        -= Subtract and assign var a=20; a-=10; Now a = 10<br>
        *= Multiply and assign var a=10; a*=20; Now a = 200<br>
        /= Divide and assign var a=10; a/=2; Now a = 5<br>
        %= Modulus and assign var a=10; a%=2; Now a = 0<br>
    </li><br>
    <br>
    Q.13 What is condition statement ?<br>
    -->JavaScript condition statement is used to execute the code whether condition is true or false. There are three
    forms of if statement in JavaScript.<br>
    1.If Statement

    -->There are four types of loops in JavaScript.<br>
    1.for loop
    2.while loop
    3.do-while loop
    4.for-in loop<br>
    And switch statement is used to execute one code from multiple expressions. It is just like else if
    statement that we have learned in previous page. But it is convenient than if..else..if because it can be used with
    numbers, characters etc.<br>
    <br>
    Q.15 What is a Function in Js? How to type and define that?<br>
    -->a function is a "subprogram" that can be called by code external (or internal, in the case of recursion) to the
    function.<br>
    Pre-defined Functions<br>
    User-defined Functions<br>
    <br>
    Q.16 What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?<br>
    -->There are four types of loops in JavaScript.<br>
    1.for loop
    2.while loop
    3.do-while loop
    4.for-in loop<br>
    <br>
    Q.17 What is the use of isNaN function?<br>
    -->The isNaN() function determines whether a value is NaN, first converting the value to a number if necessary.
    Because coercion inside the isNaN() function can be surprising, you may prefer to use Number.isNaN().<br>
    <br>
    Q.18 what is Array in js how can define?<br>
    -->The Array object, as with arrays in other programming languages, enables storing a collection of multiple items
    under a single variable name, and has members for performing common array operations.<br>
    <br>
    Q.19 What is Object in js ?<br>
    -->A javaScript object is an entity having state and behavior (properties and method). For example: car, pen, bike,
    chair, glass, keyboard, monitor etc.<br>
    JavaScript is an object-based language. Everything is an object in JavaScript.<br>
    <br>
    Q.20 Array method in js How to use it?<br>
    -->Array & methods :
    <script>
        let a = [10,20,30,40,50]
        // methods:
        console.log(a.push(10));
        console.log(a.pop());
        console.log(a.shift());
        console.log(a.unshift(10));
    </script>
    <br>
    <br>

    Q.21 Object method in js how to define?<br>
    -->To access the object, a method can use the this keyword.<br>
    let user = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,

    sayHi() {
    // "this" is the "current object"
    alert(this.name);
    }

    };<br>
    <br>
    Q.22 What is the use of Void (0)? <br>
    -->The void operator is used to evaluate an expression and returns the undefined.The javascript:void(0) can be used
    when we don't want to refresh or load a new page in the browser on clicking a hyperlink.<br>
    <br>
    Q.23 Form validation IN js ?<br>
    -->JavaScript provides facility to validate the form on the client-side so data processing will be faster than
    server-side validation.
    JavaScript, we can validate name, password, email, date, mobile numbers and more fields.<br>
    <script>
        function validateform() {
            var name = document.myform.name.value;
            var password = document.myform.password.value;

            if (name == null || name == "") {
                alert("Name can't be blank");
                return false;
            } else if (password.length < 6) {
                alert("Password must be at least 6 characters long.");
                return false;
            }
        }  
    </script>

    <body>
        <form name="myform" method="post" action="abc.jsp" onsubmit="return validateform()">
            Name: <input type="text" name="name"><br />
            Password: <input type="password" name="password"><br />
            <input type="submit" value="register">
        </form><br>
        <br>
        Q.24 Form in Email ,mobile validation?<br>
        -->
        <script>
            function validateform() {
                var email = document.myform.email.value;
                var mobile = document.myform.mobile.value;

                if (email == null || email == "") {
